# Ray Tracing in One Weekend (Rust)
Curriculum from https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview done in Rust.

Chapter 1 - 3
- Create a PPM file, a format that specifies height, width, and RGB values for each pixel.
- Create a vec3 class (created a struct with type aliases in Rust instead, along with methods for the struct)
    - Feels like a data-type oriented OOP language, reminds me of Haskell
